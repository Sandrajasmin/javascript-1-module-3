// What is a Synchronous System?
// In a synchronous system, tasks are completed one after another.
//
// Think of this as if you have just one hand to
// accomplish 10 tasks. So, you have to complete one task at a time.
//
// Take a look at the GIF ðŸ‘‡ â€“ one thing is happening at a time her

//
// You'll see that until the first image is
// loaded completely, the second image doesn't start loading.
//
//     Well, JavaScript is by default
//     Synchronous [single threaded]. Think about it like this â€“ one thread means one hand with which to do stuff.


//
// What is an Asynchronous System?
//     In this system, tasks are completed independently.
//
//     Here, imagine that for 10 tasks, you have 10 hands. So, each hand can do each task independently and at the same time.
//
//     Take a look at the GIF ðŸ‘‡ â€“ you can see that each image loads at the same time.

// Again, all the images are loading at their own pace. None of them is waiting for any of the others.



// Synchronous system, three images are in the same lane. One can't overtake the other. The race is finished one by one. If image number 2 stops, the following image stops.

// Asynchronous system, the three images are in different lanes. They'll finish the race on their own pace. Nobody stops for anybody:



// Synchronous Code Example

console.log(" I ");
console.log(" eat ");
console.log(" meatballs ");


// Asynchronous Code Example

console.log(" I ");
setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log(" eat ");
}, 5000)
console.log("Ice Cream");





function printMessage(message) {
    // i want to check if there is no message
    // i want to assign text to this message
    // i want to console log the message
    if(!message) {
    message= "No Value is here";
    }
    console.log(message);
}

printMessage();

// default value for the property argument

function printMessage(message = "No value is here two"){
    console.log(message);
}

printMessage("eyey sandra");

// Example 3

function getSome(numA = 10, numB = 2){
    return numA + numB;
}

const totalSum = getSome(4, 4);

console.log("totalSum: " + totalSum);

const totalSum2 = getSome();
console.log(totalSum2);
